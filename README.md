# SolarSight

## Inspiration

Solar Sight is inspired by the wonder and fascination that solar eclipses inspire, and the desire to make information about these rare astronomical events more accessible to the general public. The goal of the project is to provide a fun and interactive way for users to learn about the different types of solar eclipses, and to raise awareness about the importance of preserving our natural environment for future generations.

## What it does

Solar Sight is a web-based platform that enables users to explore and learn about different types of solar eclipses, including total, partial, and annular eclipses. The platform provides users with detailed information about each type of eclipse, including its causes, characteristics, and viewing tips. The system is built using modern web technologies, including ReactJS for the frontend which is deployed in GitHub pages and FastAPI for the backend which is deployed in GCP, making it easy for users to access and interact with the platform from anywhere in the world. And twilio service is provided to give view tips to the user regarding the eclipse.

## How we built it

The Solar Sight platform was built using a combination of modern web technologies and cloud-based infrastructure. We collected data and images of different types of solar eclipses from various sources, including NASA and other scientific institutions, and used this data to build our web application. We utilised ReactJS to create a user-friendly and responsive frontend, while the backend was built using FastAPI to provide scalability, reliability,security and also connected twilio to the backend for providing the tips according to the predictions made by the model. We also integrated GitHub for version control and continuous deployment, ensuring that any changes to the frontend are automatically deployed to the live website.

## Challenges we ran into

One of the significant challenges faced while building Solar Sight was ensuring that the platform was both informative and engaging for a broad audience. Additionally, building a robust and scalable infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform required careful planning and optimization.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

The Solar Sight project has resulted in several notable accomplishments, including the development of a web-based platform that provides comprehensive information about different types of solar eclipses, a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for anyone to learn about these rare astronomical events, and the integration of modern web technologies and cloud-based infrastructure to provide scalability and reliability. These achievements demonstrate the potential of technology to make information about the natural world more accessible and engaging for a wider audience.


## What we learned

Building Solar Sight has taught us several important lessons about the potential of modern web technologies and cloud-based infrastructure to make information about the natural world more accessible to the general public. We learned that building a user-friendly and engaging frontend is essential for attracting and retaining users, and that a scalable and reliable backend is crucial for ensuring that the platform can handle increased traffic and usage. Deploying to GitHub Pages can streamline the development process and ensure that changes to the frontend are immediately reflected on the live website. Instead of continuous deployment, updates can be deployed to GitHub Pages to make changes visible on the website.

## What's next for Solar Sight

Future work for Solar Sight can include expanding the platform to cover other astronomical events, such as lunar eclipses and meteor showers. Additionally, incorporating interactive visualisations and animations can make the platform even more engaging and informative. Finally, leveraging social media and other marketing channels can help raise awareness about the platform and its importance in promoting environmental awareness and scientific literacy.
